twitter_who_to_follow.py : this script allows you to fetch and save basic data of all the followers of a target twitter account(it could be your competitor or a company in similar domain), then based on some keywords you can filter accounts which then the script allows your own account to follow. This tactic can allow you to build initial followers on a new company twitter account.
